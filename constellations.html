      <p class="font-bold text-white w-1/4 font-mono">Iota Cancri</p>
      <p class="text-white w-3/4 font-mono">Also known as ι Cancri, is a double star in the constellation Cancer approximately 300 light years from Earth. The brighter star, ι Cancri A, is a yellow G-type giant with an apparent magnitude of +4.02. It is a mild barium star, thought to be formed by mass transfer of enriched material from an asymptotic giant branch star onto a less evolved companion. No such donor has been detected in the ι Cancri system, but it is assumed that there is an unseen white dwarf.
    The fainter of the two stars, ι Cancri B, is a white A-type main sequence dwarf with an apparent magnitude of +6.57. It is a shell star, surrounded by material expelled by its rapid rotation.</p>

      <p class="text-white w-3/4 font-mono">Also known as γ Cancri. It is located at a distance of approximately 181 light years from the Sun. It's a white-hued A-type subgiant with a magnitude of 4.67 and is 35 times more luminous than the Sun. It is easily visible to the naked eye from dark locations. </p>

    <!-- Star 3 -->

      <p class="font-bold text-white w-1/4 font-mono">Asellus Australis</p>
      <p class="text-white w-3/4 font-mono">It is one of the two stars known as "Asellus," the other being Asellus Borealis in the same constellation. Asellus Australis, also known as Gamma Cancri, is a relatively dim star, with a spectral classification of K5III, which means it is a red giant. This star is approximately 180 light-years away from Earth. In the context of astronomy, the name "Asellus" comes from the Latin word for "little donkey," as the stars were originally thought to resemble a donkey pulling a cart in the sky. Asellus Australis and Asellus Borealis are part of the small cluster of stars within the Cancer constellation, which itself is relatively faint but rich in deep-sky objects.</p>

    <!-- Star 4 -->
    <div class="flex border-b border-white py-2">
      <p class="font-bold text-white w-1/4 font-mono">Acubens</p>
      <p class="text-white w-3/4 font-mono">Acubens, also known as Alpha Cancri. It is a binary star system located about 174 light-years from Earth. Acubens has a spectral classification of A5III, meaning it is a white giant star. The name "Acubens" comes from the Arabic word al-‘Awwā', which translates to "the claws" and refers to its position in the Cancer constellation, which represents the claws of the crab in Greek mythology.
        As part of the Cancer constellation, Acubens helps define the shape of the crab, with the star located near the center of the constellation's asterism. Though it is not one of the brightest stars in the night sky, it is notable for being a prominent marker within the constellation, and it has been a part of navigational astronomy for centuries.</p>

    <!-- Star 5 -->
    <div class="flex border-b border-white py-2">
      <p class="font-bold text-white w-1/4 font-mono">27 Cancri</p>
      <p class="text-white w-3/4">27 Cancri is a star in the Cancer constellation, located approximately 410 light-years from Earth. It is a binary star system, with its primary component being a G-type giant star, similar to the Sun but more evolved. The star has a spectral classification of G8III, indicating it is a yellow giant. The companion star is a smaller, less luminous object, which is typical of binary systems.
        While 27 Cancri is not among the brightest stars in the constellation, it is notable for its position in Cancer and its role in the constellation's rich star field. It is relatively close to the ecliptic plane, which means it can sometimes be observed in the path of the Sun's apparent motion across the sky. The star's name, like many in the Cancer constellation, ties into the region's association with the zodiac sign of Cancer, represented by the crab in Greek mythology.</p>

    <!-- Star 6 -->
    <div class="flex py-2">
      <p class="font-bold text-white w-1/4 font-mono">Altarf</p>
      <p class="text-white w-3/4 font-mono">also known as Delta Cancri, is a star in the Cancer constellation, located about 180 light-years from Earth. It has a spectral classification of G8III, indicating that it is a yellow giant star, similar to the Sun but in a later stage of its evolution. As a giant star, Al Tarf has expanded and cooled after exhausting the hydrogen in its core, making it much larger and more luminous than it was in its main sequence phase.
        The name Al Tarf comes from the Arabic word al-ṭarf, meaning "the corner," which refers to its position marking one of the "corners" of the crab in the Cancer constellation. Despite being a relatively faint star, Al Tarf is still an important part of the constellation, helping to define its shape in the night sky. It’s one of the stars that makes up the asterism representing the crab's body in the zodiac.</p>
